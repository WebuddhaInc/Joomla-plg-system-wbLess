
# wbLess Automatic Less Compiler for Joomla!

This plugin will scan and compile less files automatically whenever Joomla loads.  The compiler only processes files where the target CSS file is older than original LESS.  The plugin can be configured to run for the Site or Admin interfaces, and can be configured to only run in a development environment.
